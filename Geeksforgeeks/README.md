  - [x] Introduction
      - **Asymptotic notations:** Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools to represent the time complexity of algorithms for asymptotic analysis. The following 3 asymptotic notations are mostly used to represent the time complexity of algorithms
         1) Θ Notation: 
         2) Big O Notation: 
         3) Ω Notation: 
      - **We can have three cases to analyze an algorithm:**
          1) Worst Case
          2) Average Case
          3) Best Case
      - **Important Points:**
              Most of the times, we do the worst case analysis to analyze algorithms. In the worst analysis, we guarantee an upper bound on the running time of an algorithm which is a good piece of information.
              The average case analysis is not easy to do in most of the practical cases and it is rarely done. In the average case analysis, we must know (or predict) the mathematical distribution of all possible inputs.
              The Best Case analysis is bogus. Guaranteeing a lower bound on an algorithm doesn't provide any information as in the worst case, an algorithm may take years to run.
