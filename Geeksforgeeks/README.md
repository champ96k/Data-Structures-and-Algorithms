### • Week 1
  - [x] Mathematics
      - **Series:** We'll learn about the two most important series-AP and GP.
      - **Equations:** We'll look at the quadratic formula and how to use it to solve quadratic equations.
      - **Numbers:** Prime numbers and use of sieve of Eratosthenes.
      - **Multiples and Factors:** What is LCM? How is GCD related to LCM? Other important terms like factors, multiples. Theorems like Euclid's algorithms for GCD, it's an extended version.
      - **Combinatorics:** What is factorial? We'll learn about permutations and combinations.
      - **Modular Arithmetic:** Various properties of modular arithmetic.

  - [x] Recursion
      - **Recursion Basics:** What exactly is recursion and why it's important.
      - **Advantages:** Why is recursion code easier to write than it's the iterative counterpart.
      - **Types:** We'll look at head recursion and Tail recursion.
      - **Problems:** How do we approach a question that is to be solved by recursion.
  - [x] Arrays: 
      - **Arrays:** What are arrays and why are they used.
      - **Basic Operations:** We'll look at basic array operations like insertion, deletion,and reversal.
      - **Shifting and Rotation:** How to shift and rotate an array.
      - **Sum Arrays:** How do we create a prefix sum array and when do we need it.
      - **Sliding Window:** Using the sliding window to improve the complexity of our program.
