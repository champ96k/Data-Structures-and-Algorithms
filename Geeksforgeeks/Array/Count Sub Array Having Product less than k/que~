Given an array of positive numbers, the task is to find the number of possible contiguous subarrays having product less than a given number K.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. First line of each test case contains two integers N & K and the second line contains N space separated array elements.

Output:
For each test case, print the count of required subarrays in new line.

Constraints:
1<=T<=200
1<=N<=105
1<=K<=1015
1<=A[i]<=105

Example:
Input:
2
4 10
1 2 3 4
7 100
1 9 2 8 6 4 3

Output:
7
16

Explanation:

Input : A[]={1, 2,3,4} 
        K = 10
Output : 7
The contiguous subarrays are {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}
{1, 2}, {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3} whose count is
