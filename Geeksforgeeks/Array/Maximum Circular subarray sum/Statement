Given an array arr[] of N integers arranged in a circular fashion. Your task is to find the maximum contigious subarray sum.

Input:
First line of input contains a single integer T which denotes the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains a single integer N which denotes the total number of elements. Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
For each test case print the maximum sum obtained by adding the consecutive elements.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 101
1 <= N <= 106
-106 <= Arr[i] <= 106

Example:
Input:
3
7
8 -8 9 -9 10 -11 12
8
10 -3 -4 7 6 5 -4 -1
8
-1 40 -14 7 6 5 -4 -1

Output:
22
23
52

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Starting from last element of the array, i.e, 12, and moving in circular fashion, we have max subarray as 12, 8, -8, 9, -9, 10, which gives maximum sum as 22.
