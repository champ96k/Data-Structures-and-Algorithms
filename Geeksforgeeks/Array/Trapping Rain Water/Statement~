Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing the height of blocks at index i as Ai where the width of each block is 1. Compute how much water can be trapped in between blocks after raining.

We can trap 2 units of water in the middle gap.



Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {7,4,0,9}
Output: 10
Explanation: Water trapped by the 
block of height 4 is 3 units, block 
of height 0 is 7 units. So, the 
total unit of water trapped is 
10 units.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {6,9,9}
Output: 0
Explanation: No water will be trapped.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function trappingWater() which returns the total amount of water that can be trapped.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
