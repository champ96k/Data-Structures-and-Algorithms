Variable Sized Arrays


Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  (the number of variable-length arrays) and  (the number of queries).
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 describing the -element array located at .
Each of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  (an index in array ) and  (an index in the array referenced by ) for a query.

Constraints

All indices in this challenge are zero-based.
All the given numbers are non negative and are not greater than 
Output Format

For each pair of  and  values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer denoting the element located at index  of the array referenced by . There should be a total of  lines of output.
